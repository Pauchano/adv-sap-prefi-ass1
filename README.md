## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
	Method of software development that uses software components called services to create business applications. Each service provides a business capability, and services can also communicate with each other across platforms and languages.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
	Microservices architecture- multiple components, business approach, simple routing, decentralized, failure resistant, and evolutionary. One can use it for website migration, media content, transaction and invoices, and data processing.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
	Base on my understating it Allows development teams to build, deploy, and manage modern applications efficiently for cloud environments. That said, microservices offer certain advantages over SOA deployments.
